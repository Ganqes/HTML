<h1>Hotstar</h1>
Disney+ Hotstar is an Indian subscription video-on-demand over-the-top streaming service owned by Disney Star, a subsidiary of the Disney Entertainment business segment of The Walt Disney Company, featuring domestic Indian film, television and sports content for India itself and its worldwide diaspora. It also includes imported content from and serves Southeast Asia as well.
      <p>
The brand was introduced as Hotstar for a streaming service carrying content from Disney Star's local networks, including films, television series, live sports, and original programming, as well as featuring content licensed from third parties such as Showtime among others. Amid the significant growth of mobile broadband in India, Hotstar quickly became the dominant streaming service in the country.
       <br>
Following the acquisition of Star India's parent company 21st Century Fox by Disney in 2019, Hotstar was integrated into the company's new global streaming brand Disney+ as 'Disney+ Hotstar' in April 2020. The co-branded service added Disney+ original programming, and films and television series from its main content brands of Walt Disney Studios, Pixar, Marvel Studios, Lucasfilm, and National Geographic alongside the domestic and third-party content already carried on the platform.
